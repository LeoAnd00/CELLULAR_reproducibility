**cell_type_annotation_loss_comp:** Contains code for visualizing the comparison between different loss functions.
1. Code for training the model on the different loss functions can be found in */train_code*.
2. Run *Calc_metrics.ipynb* to concatenate all cell type annotation results into */results_and_visualizations*
3. Run *visualize_metrics.ipynb* to make visualizations.
